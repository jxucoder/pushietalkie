# Hold to Talk

Free, open-source voice dictation for macOS. Hold a key, speak, release — your words appear wherever your cursor is. Nothing ever leaves your Mac.

- **Fully private** — powered by [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit), transcription runs entirely on Apple Silicon via Core ML. No cloud, no accounts, no network calls.
- **Works everywhere** — dictate into any app: Slack, Notes, your IDE, email, browser — anywhere you can type.
- **Apple Intelligence cleanup** (optional) — on-device grammar and filler-word removal. Customizable prompt. Requires macOS 26+.
- **Auto-updates** — built-in update checking via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org).
- **Stays out of your way** — lives in your menu bar. Hold a key to record, release to paste. That's it.

## Architecture

```
HoldToTalkApp          SwiftUI menu bar app, entry point
DictationEngine        Orchestrator: record → transcribe → cleanup → paste
AudioRecorder          AVAudioEngine mic capture, resamples to 16 kHz mono
Transcriber            WhisperKit wrapper, lazy model loading
TextProcessor          On-device text cleanup via Apple Intelligence
TextInserter           Multi-strategy text insertion (Accessibility API, keyboard events, clipboard)
HotkeyManager          NSEvent global/local monitor for modifier keys
ModelManager           Whisper model download and lifecycle management
RecordingHUD           Floating overlay showing recording state
OnboardingView         Guided setup flow for first launch
SettingsView           SwiftUI settings form
```

Dependencies: [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) (transcription) and [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) (auto-updates). No network calls for transcription — everything runs locally.
